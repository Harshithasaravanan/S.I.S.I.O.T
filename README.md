# S.I.S.I.O.T
Automated Watering System

Irrigation and other agricultural processes leads to a lot of water being wasted. S.I.S.I.O.T aims to slash water consumption by 30% by strictly monitoring the amount of water supplied for irrigation using Ultrasonic sensors and Arduino Uno along with a stepper motor. This successfully reduced water consumption and prevented wastage of water.
